## ABOUT
A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given such a sequence, it assigns a probability to the whole sequence. The language model provides context to distinguish between words and phrases that sound similar. Predicting the probability of a word in a sentence is a fundamental task in natural language processing. It is used in many NLP applications such as autocomplete, spelling correction, or text generation. Language models can be used to predict a word in a sentence based on surrounding words. They can also be used to correct a real-word or non-word error in a query by suggesting the best possible replacement based on the context.

## CONTENTS
<ul>
  <li> TEXT GENERATION (TEXT_GENERATOR.py) : It takes some incomplete text/query from the user and then completes that query based on a language model that the user chooses. In the entire project, mainly 4 language models are used (unigram, bigram, trigram, quadgram). The meaningfulness of a complete sentence generated by the program depends on the model chosen. While a unigram model might simple concatenate the most common words together, an n-gram model of length greater than one will derive some context from the previous words in the sentence and accordingly choose the next word.
